# Simon Game Challenge
### This website is presently hosted at https://basuabhirup.github.io/simon-game/

This is a practice project to sharpen my proficiency in JavaScript, HTML &amp; CSS. Here I have used the jQuery library, instead of the vanilla JavaScript to manipulate the DOM elements. 

The original idea is inspired from Dr. Angela Yu, CTO, The London App Brewery, UK. I am happy to host this website to showcase my creative and technical skills online.
